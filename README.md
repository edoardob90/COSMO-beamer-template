# COSMO-beamer-template
A template for presentation with LaTeX Beamer class

This is a template to use LaTeX Beamer-class to build presentations, derived from modification of the "Torino" theme by M. Barisione. To use it, you can download and directly compile the MAIN.tex file, which includes the actual content (to be put in CONTENT.tex).

The previous flaw in the title page has now been fixed. DO NOT move default logos from the "Pictures" folder.
